I am Cristiane Martins, a committed journalist driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge. I excel in embracing new challenges, with a particular interest in the field of NLP.

I completed the Data Citizen Bootcamp offered by CambridgeSpark in 2022. This comprehensive experience sharpened my data skills, enabling me to proficiently handle data collection, cleaning, analysis, and effective communication of insights.

I am in the final stages of my second bootcamp with HyperionDev, which began in February. This intensive program has pushed me to broaden my horizons and acquire invaluable skills. It has also cultivated an analytical approach to problem-solving and decision-making, which I am eager to utilise in my future career.

I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my newly acquired skills, whether through an apprenticeship program or as a junior data analyst.
