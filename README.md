Hi! Iâ€™m starting my career as a data analyst with a blend of experiences in fashion design, communication, and technology. My journey started in the fashion industry, where I developed my passion for design, fabrics, and business. Later, my interest in technology and data led me to transition into the digital realm after immersing myself in fashion marketing, and journalism.

Driven by my quest for knowledge, I attended two intensive boot camps, which gave me the skills to handle data gathering, cleaning, and sharing analysis and insights. The first bootcamp with CambridgeSpark in 2022 offered me data fundamentals, while the second one with HyperionDev in 2023 significantly enhanced my proficiency in Python, SQL, statistics, and machine learning.

As I went deeper into data science, a realisation dawned on me: I could merge my strong communication skills with my enthusiasm for fashion and technology.

If you share my interest in this dynamic intersection of fashion and tech, let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities ahead!
